# odin-recipes
For the recipes project of TOP.
The date is 1/04/25.
I have just learned the basics of html and I aim to demonstrate my new skills
through this project.

This project aimed to improve my coding skills- All recipes were written by AI while
I coded the actual website using html.

This project succesfully reinforced my understanding of html basics and I am now ready to
move on to the next stage of TOP, which I believe is an introduction to CSS.
